I'm fine with both desktop and web apps even if I really prefer desktop (and native) software, but I also want to improve my web skills.<br>\nI don't care if a solution already exists, I don't care about reinventing the wheel, I like making my own version of software I use and it's a good way to learn how to make this kind of stuff.</p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning</li>\n<li>Share my work</li>\n<li>Increase my presence on the web</li>\n<li>It will add projects to my portfolio</li>\n<li>Making money (This is a bonus)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The projects</h2>\n<p>I will work on really different projects, from web to desktop and even terminal based software. They will be open source except for web apps and I plan to share when something is finished. They don't have to be difficult, but just well executed and idealy taking about 2-3 weeks.  </p>\n<p>This is a small post because I don't know what to write, but it's a way to commit myself to this challenge and maybe it will inspire someone in the future.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 9th, 2022","title":"12 projects in 12 months","description":"Making 12 projects in 12 months"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/12projects12months/"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
