# 12 Projects in 12 months

This month (June) is the 6th month of my challenge, and honestly, I failed hard, but it doesn't mean it's a bad thing.

## What was my goals

- Learning
- Share my work
- Increase my presence on the web
- Add projects to my portfolio
- Making money (This is a bonus)

## The only project I did: Cronarium

I wanted to work on many things from desktop application to SaaS to improve myself and learn new things,
I had a tiny list in my head of the fields for the projects:

- SaaS (TypeScript, React, MongoDB)
- Desktop application (C++ with KDE Kirigami framework)
- Web assembly
- Mobile (game or application)
- Cryptography
- Blockchain

I chose the SaaS because I wanted to try to make some money with it, so making a SaaS during the first month then moving
on the next project while maybe making some money with the first.  
  
Spoiler, it didn't go as expected and as a result 6 months later I'm still on the same project:
Cronarium, a job scheduler SaaS to monitor web things, because building a SaaS is more than just building an application.  
  
## Why I didn't give up and moved on the next project ?

I started this challenge to force myself to code, learn and improve my portfolio, but when I started, I also started
to **build in public** on twitter, and because my current project was a SaaS, I started to follow people that were also
building a SaaS and I was highly motivated, but at the same time I had only 1 day per week to work on it.  
  
I got somethings working the first month but it was ugly, then I didn't care to spend 1 more month on it, but after 2
months my motivation started to lower, I had doubts about what was the purpose of this project, if I should really
make money from it, maintains it, add more features or just making it open source and move on the next project.   
  
After a pause (we're 4 months from the beginning), I came back and set a list of features and milestones for the project,
I almost refactored the whole application because I wasn't happy with the current state of the code.

## What's next ?

I'm stopping this challenge at this point, I already lost, but for the best because I learned a lot of things and will
probably dedicate a post to it.  
  
However I will continue to build in public, share my work on twitter or other media.
I don't know what will be my next projects because I'm still working on Cronarium for now, and I really want to finish it.
