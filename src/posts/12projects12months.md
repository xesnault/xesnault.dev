# 12 Projects in 12 months

I'm starting today my 12 projects in 12 months challenge, we all have different reasons and goals, here are mine.

## Context

I really like coding, especially with C++ and I started learning typescript 3 years ago. I'm fine with both desktop and web apps even if I really prefer desktop (and native) software, but I also want to improve my web skills.  
I don't care if a solution already exists, I don't care about reinventing the wheel, I like making my own version of software I use and it's a good way to learn how to make this kind of stuff.

## Goals

- Learning
- Share my work
- Increase my presence on the web
- It will add projects to my portfolio
- Making money (This is a bonus)

## The projects

I will work on really different projects, from web to desktop and even terminal based software. They will be open source except for web apps and I plan to share when something is finished. They don't have to be difficult, but just well executed and idealy taking about 2-3 weeks.  
  
This is a small post because I don't know what to write, but it's a way to commit myself to this challenge and maybe it will inspire someone in the future.
